#  Travel App Take-Home Exercise

In this take-home interview exercise we'd like you to consider the hypothetical "Travel" app attached that lets you book a flight by selecting 'from' and 'to' airports, and then pressing a 'Submit' button.

The problem we'd like you to solve is that currently the search screen is very unresponsive, there are noticeable lag/freezes when as you're typing in each character to the search bar.

Rules/guidelines:

1. Feel free to consult any resources / use any libraries that you would advocate for in the real world to solve this problem.
If you include libraries in your result please integrate them in whatever way is fastest for you (drag in a xcodeproj, setup cocoapods, etc...) you will *not* be evaluated for project structure / choice of dependency management etc...
2. Feel free to take a look but do not change anything in the `AirportSearchDataSource.swift` file, the goal of the exercise is to improve the search user experience while maintaining the artificial delay in that file.
3. Try to spend a maximum of 60 minutes on the problem, we recommend breaking this down into 
    a. 5-10 minutes of browsing the code and playing with the app in the simulator to triage the issues with the current application
    b. ~40 minutes of attempting to improve the user experience the most you can in that time frame
    c. ~10 minutes of reflecting on your solution and jotting down some notes for how you would improve the app even further if this were a real project and the constraints of this exercise were removed, we'll talk through your thoughts here in person
